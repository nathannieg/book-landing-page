        Sunshine Girl <br /><span>an unexpected life</span>
      </h1>
      <p class="book__description">
        Known for her outstanding performances on the groundbreaking television
        series The Good Wife and ER, Julianna Margulies deftly chronicles her
        life and her work in this deeply powerful memoir.<br /><br />
        As an apple-cheeked bubbly child, Julianna was bestowed with the family
        nickname “Sunshine Girl.” Shuttled back and forth between her divorced
        parents, often on different continents, she quickly learned how to be of
        value to her eccentric mother and her absent father. Raised in fairly
        unconventional ways in various homes in Paris, England, New York, and
        New Hampshire, Julianna found that her role among the surrounding
        turmoil and uncertainty was to comfort those around her, seeking
        organization among the disorder, making her way in the world as a young
        adult and eventually an award-winning actress.<br /><br />
        Throughout, there were complicated relationships, difficult choices, and
        overwhelming rejections. But there were also the moments where fate,
        faith, and talent aligned, leading to the unforgettable roles of a
        lifetime, both professionally and personally—moments when chaos had
        finally turned to calm.<br /><br />
        Filled with intimate stories and revelatory moments, Sunshine Girl is at
        once unflinchingly honest and perceptive. It is a riveting self-portrait
        of a woman whose resilience in the face of turmoil will leave readers
        intrigued and inspired.
