This project was developed as part of my training in web development. My purpose here is to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and responsive web applications only.

I use as inspiration the book "Sunshine Girl: an unexpected life", but the idea is that with a few simple changes, one would be able to change the content and color pallette.

I am in now way affiliated with the author or Penguin Random House, nor am I making any profit off of this.
