# Book Landing Page

This project was developed as part of my training in web development. My purpose here is to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and responsive web applications only.

I use as inspiration the book "Sunshine Girl: an unexpected life", but the idea is that with a few simple changes, one would be able to change the content and color pallette.

I am in now way affiliated with the author or Penguin Random House, nor am I making any profit off of this.
